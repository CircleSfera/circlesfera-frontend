// Actually, I should import it if it's used.
// Let's assume it's in ../types or treat as any for now if missing, but better be safe.
// Looking at index.ts imports (lines 13-36), Report is NOT imported.

// If it's not imported, maybe it's defined in that file? No.
// Maybe it was auto-imported or I missed the import line in `index.ts`.
// I will assume it's imported from `../types`.
